full_description: In the beginning, as equal parts art gallery, fabrication shop and
  design studio, we were known for fingerless gloves and raffish outbursts that helped
  jumpstart Kansas City’s emergent culture. Today, we work purposefully across scales,
  locations, and contexts, from city blocks to exhibitions, between critical ideas
  and our intangible, spiritual attachment to place. El Dorado’s two partners and
  20 staff — including 11 architects, 2 university professors, industrial designers
  and certified welders — chase big ideas with a common touch.
