short-description: Transforming 48 acres of abandoned industrial relics into 100 acres
  of revitalized, ecologically sound, mixed-use development.
description: |-
  This project is the redevelopment of a 100+ acre former industrial plant along the Mississippi River approximately four miles north of downtown Minneapolis. The site, once a thriving source of job creation and economic vitality, now sits wholly abandoned, and poses an environmental threat to the river and the surrounding neighborhood.

  EL DORADO and Coen+Partners have developed a plan that infuses forward-thinking transit strategies into a mixed use development to sustain and modernize the former industrial site. Innovative approaches to corridor design strengthen connections to an existing local workforce while offering sustainable and performative environmental strategies to assist in remediating the brownfield conditions found throughout the site. The project will ultimately evolve as a public-private partnership with the City of Minneapolis, introducing an extensive riverfront park, multi-modal transportation systems, a new outdoor music venue design by SHoP Architects, and new models for dense, mixed income housing.
