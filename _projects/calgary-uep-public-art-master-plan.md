short-description: Creative public art plan shifting the mundane workings of a city
  into magnetic expression
description: |-
  In the spring of 2016, a multidisciplinary consultant team led by art practice Sans façon was selected to collaborate with The City of Calgary Utilities and Environmental Protection Department (UEP) to create phase II of their public art plan. One of the programs that resulted from phase I was WATERSHED+, a visionary arts initiative created by Sans façon with the Water Resources & Water Services division that, through embedding artists and their creative processes within the core activities of the UEP, provides Calgarians opportunities to build an emotional connection to their precious watershed ecosystem.

  Phase II emphasizes the importance of the land itself, and the fundamental values of environmental stewardship. Our work as a project team asks the fundamental question: how can artists catalyze public belief in the value of municipal service? Through this plan, artists will work alongside city services including water, global warming, and environmental protection units, to address Calgary’s largest and most urgent questions.
