short-description: Space utilized as an event space in connection with Willoughby
  Design Group's work as a graphic design firm and business identity consultant.
description: |-
  Ann Willoughby desired a structure to complement her existing 1880s farmhouse on her working farm outside of Kansas City, Mo. She utilizes the structure as an event space in connection with her design firm, Willoughby Design Group. Aside from the industrial and agricultural functions that comprise the entire lower level of the barn, the project included an open event space, an insulated and climate controlled utility/washroom area and a sleeping loft. The barn frame, purchased by the client in the spring of 1998, was originally located in Highland, Kansas. Carefully sited in its new home, the barn is sheathed in corrugated copper and fiberglass panels.

  The barn’s flexible space has hosted everything from company retreats and weddings to national conferences and seminars. Willoughby Design liked it so much they based their brand identity off its iconic form.
