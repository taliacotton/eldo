short-description: Striking a balance between honoring the integrity of the site and
  designing a boldly contemporary project
description: 'Located in the Flint Hills of Kansas—the country’s last remaining tallgrass
  prairie—this residence for a family of five is be sited on a flat limestone outcropping
  of their farmstead. Our scheme bends with the contours of the hill, and is sited
  to make the most of passive heating by the sun and cooling by the constant breezes.
  The house is divided into four sections: garage, living and dining room, master
  bedroom, and children’s bedrooms. Each section has a pitched roof, the distinguishing
  feature of the region’s barns and outbuildings, and they are linked together by
  two glass-enclosed breezeways with flat, planted roofs. The garage and children’s
  bedroom are angled outward to open up the living room to expansive views of the
  surrounding landscape. A pond sits at the bottom of the hill, and the other farm
  structures are visible in the distance. The materials are simple and durable: reclaimed
  lumber siding, a standing seam metal roof and a stone base.'
