short-description: With a focus on cubic feet rather than area; the design team created
  a small box that wasn't dwarfed by it's neighbors, lifting it up to give it a presence.
description: This new-construction residence in Kansas Cityâ€™s Westside Neighborhood
  was both designed and contracted by El Dorado principal, Jamie Darnell, for himself
  and his family. Elegant and spare, it combines clean lines and durable materials
  (concrete, corrugated copper, glue-laminated timber, chain link fencing and ipe
  decking) into a dynamic form that respects both the scale of the neighborhood and
  the energy of its new residents. The residence is extremely efficient and well lit
  and it utilizes a Structural Insulated Panel System, which saved labor and material
  costs during construction and has resulted in significant energy savings throughout
  the year.
