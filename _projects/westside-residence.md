short-description: A small residential box, carefully lit and lifted to give it a
  presence bigger than its size
description: "This new residence in Kansas City's Westside neighborhood was both designed
  and built by its owner for his family of four. Elegant and spare, it combines clean
  lines and durable materials (concrete, corrugated copper, glue-laminated timber,
  chain link fencing and ipe decking) into a dynamic form that respects both the scale
  of the neighborhood and the energy of its new residents.  Care was given to introduce
  daylight into every space in the house while controlling views both in and out.
  The form is carefully placed within, and actively engages the site and its surroundings.
  \n\nThe residence is extremely efficient and well lit. It utilizes a structural
  insulated panel System for the envelope, saving labor and material costs during
  construction, and resulting in significant energy savings throughout the year.  "
