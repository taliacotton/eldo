short-description: A restrained palette broadcasts the optimism of the Girl Scouts.
description: Camp Prairie Schooner sits high on the bluffs of the Little Blue River,
  and with 176 wooded acres, the camp feels like wilderness in the heart of Kansas
  City. In addition to numerous constructed activities, creeks, hills, and a nature
  trail surround the site. The project encompasses a highly cost-effective and year-round
  trail center and troop house, bunk rooms, flex rooms, full kitchens, modern restrooms
  and a shower facility. The design solution links two volumes through a shared mechanical
  room that efficiently serves both volumes. Standard, off-the-rack scissor trusses
  give the roof iconic form and inexpensive painted corrugated metal provides the
  skin. Vibrant endwalls provide way-finding for campers and identify individual troops.
