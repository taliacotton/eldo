short-description: Elegant detailing and a reverence for natural light create a cathedral
  to brewing
description: Boulevard Brewing tapped El Dorado and our design-build team to expand
  their facility at the corner of 25th Street and Southwest Boulevard just west of
  the Crossroads Arts District in Kansas City. Working within the footprint of a historic
  100-year-old brick structure, we proposed expanding up, creating a new tower for
  eight stainless steel tanks. Each tank is 38 feet tall and will hold 300 barrels
  of dry hop beer. The addition was shaped by an underground river that runs below
  the northwest corner of the building, channeled by dual 9’x18’ box culverts. We
  sliced the tower volume to run parallel to the underground river. The “slice” created
  a wall of north-facing glass which opens up views of the facility and engages southbound
  traffic emerging from under a rail overpass. Vertical mesh panels reduce solar heat
  gain on the southwest and northeast facade while still allowing views of the tanks,
  which are especially visible when illuminated at night.
