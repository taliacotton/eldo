short-description: A site-sensitive response to scale, materiality, shelter, and expanse
description: |-
  The Unitarian Fellowship of Lawrence is located on a rural site
  about 10 miles south of Lawrence, Kansas. For years, the
  Fellowship held services within an existing 1880’s one-room
  schoolhouse. In the late 1960’s, the church added a classroom
  wing, which allowed the Fellowship continued growth. During the
  summer of 2006, the church elected to construct a new entry
  lobby and sanctuary large enough for 150 members, and hired an
  architect to lead a committee-based design process.
  The grounds proved to be the guiding force for the new sanctuary
  design. Century-old hedge trees line the south and west edges of
  the site. Their high canopies provide strategic summer shading
  while also framing generous views of pastures to the south. The
  new sanctuary structure, intimately nestled between the
  hedgerows and the historic schoolhouse structure, offers a site-sensitive
  response to scale, materiality, shelter, and expanse. The
  horizontal line, a poetic reference to the surrounding Kansas
  landscape, is utilized throughout the new architecture and
  underscores a Unitarian approach to spirituality rooted in
  Humanism and respect for the natural world.
