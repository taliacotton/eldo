short-description: The focus of The LUX was to balance requirements for historic tax
  credits with requirements for LEED certifications. The result was a complete building
  intent reversal, from energy hog to exemplar case of sustainability and efficiency.
description: The Kansas Gas and Electric Company headquarters was built in downtown
  Wichita, Kansas in 1953 and leveraged technology to showcase the power company’s
  full capabilities. Everything about the 8-story high rise was progressive for its
  day and was designed to create a lineage of consumption. Over time, the building
  degraded into an inefficient shell. The property came under new ownership in 2011,
  and a renovation was planned to contribute to a push for downtown revitalization
  in Wichita. The program included modern living with a mixed-use element, commercial
  spaces on the first two floors and residential on the floors above. Primary goals
  were to obtain historical tax credits, maintaining the integrity of the building
  and preserving an important piece of the city’s history, and to obtain LEED certification
  while doing so. 80-84 one, two and three-bedroom units were planned for the third
  through the eighth stories, focusing on maximizing space potential for efficient
  urban living. Micro units were also designed for the second-fourth stories. A new
  set of rooftop patios served as primary areas to achieve visually apparent green
  elements. A coffee shop was designed for one of the first floor commercial spaces.
  Just one year after the LUX opened, the building is fully occupied.
