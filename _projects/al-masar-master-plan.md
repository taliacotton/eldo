Al Masar is a comprehensive master plan that integrates a diverse set of approaches to create a vibrant society and a thriving economy.

Through the removal of a major highway system through the city, Sports Boulevard captures an opportunity to double the amount of public space in the city. The banks of ecological wadis, the right-of-way of the major road, the vast habitat systems in the desert become a innovative public park that has the power to change the lives of millions of Saudis. Through six transformations—cycling, sports, resilience, water, mobility, and culture—Sports Boulevard will nurture the growth of a vibrant society and diversify a thriving economy for an ambitious nation.
