short-description: A space that is as inventive as the food itself.
description: "After operating in a limited and challenging converted Victorian house
  for several years, the chefs and owners of Novel wanted to expand and create a space
  that exemplifies their innovative cuisine. \n\nCollaborating with local artists
  and artisans, the new space has a tough-to-achieve balance of precision, looseness,
  and rarely-found acoustical levels — letting old be old and new be new. Architecturally,
  the space has the character, depth and layers of the previous location with classic
  material detailing allowing the dining experience to be on par with, but not overwhelming
  the food at Novel. For guests, this translates into an ephemeral space grounded
  in place — the heart of downtown Kansas City’s Crossroads Art District."
