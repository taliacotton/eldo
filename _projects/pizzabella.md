short-description: Warm materials seamlessly connect indoor and outdoor dining experiences
description: Pizzabella is the third Kansas City restaurant established by Rob and
  Margarita Dalzell. The principal idea behind the design of Pizzabella was to create
  unexpected elegance by contrasting mostly neutral, inexpensive surfaces with a few,
  carefully chosen material and design highlights. For instance, the separation element
  between diners and staff is a custom made zinc-plated steel and black walnut bar,
  both at the bar and pizza ovens. Fabric-lined walls provide ambient lighting and
  adjustable spot lights over the tables that help present richly visual food at an
  accurately rendered color temperature.
