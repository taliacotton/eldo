title: ReStart Housing
short-description: reStart housing promotes the holistic development of young adults
        aging out of foster care, specifically those with mental-health diagnoses,
        in a dignified and supportive environment.
description: "Over 800 individuals age out
        of foster care each year within Jackson County, Missouri. Good quality housing
        is critical to allow young persons who haven’t had stable homes throughout
        their formative years to start their adult life on the right foot. The reStart
        Housing development in the Waldo neighborhood of Kansas City provides permanent
        housing and support services for these young adults aging out of foster care,
        specifically those with mental health diagnoses. The project, housing 14 one-bedroom
        apartments, helps them move toward independence and self-sufficiency, preemptively
        preventing homelessness before it begins. \n\nThe reStart apartments promote
        a strong sense of community for their residents. The building’s plan and section
        unfold as a series of intimate, open-air courtyards filled with sunlight that
        bring natural light deep into the center of the complex and allow cross-breeze
        ventilation into each of the dwellings. Each apartment was designed as a series
        of spaces providing varying levels of privacy or opportunities for social
        interaction, from bedroom to living room to the front porch area in the open
        air courtyard. Integration into a vital neighborhood was central to the project.
        A separate community building is attached to the main residential building
        by a common roof.\n\nThe reStart Housing development is the result of more
        than five years of research, design, community engagement and governmental
        cooperation. The project represents an apartment complex that promotes the
        holistic development of young adults, creating an avenue for each resident
        to join our communities with support and dignity."
