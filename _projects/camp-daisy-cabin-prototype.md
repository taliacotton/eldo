short-description: Camping in comfort
description: |-
  The cabin prototype was the result of a design competition within a graduate architecture studio at Kansas State University. The winning proposal was built entirely by all of the students who participated in the competition. The students learned to weld, to form and pour concrete, to frame a floor, walls and a ceiling, to install electrical components and to sew. They learned to work as a team, in true Girl Scout’s form. Three of the students were Girl Scouts. One spent many summers at Camp Daisy. Her unique insights were a major factor in her team’s winning proposal.
  This prototype offers the opportunity for girls to enjoy camping without having to give up comfort. Existing cabins are either hot or lack air flow. Cross breezes coming down the hill behind this new prototype pass through the cabin, modulated as desired by sliding screens on both sides of the cabin. A ceiling fan and an elevated floor deck provide additional passive cooling. Large windows are screened to keep bugs out. Lights and outlets are provided, inside. The cabin prototype is organized around a concept of social flexibility. The front of the cabin – a concrete sitting porch protected from the sun and rain – faces the central campfire. It’s large enough to for 2-3 cabins worth of campers. The porch “window” has a sliding canvas screen, adjustable from the outside. The back “window” has the same, though it’s adjustable from the inside. Inside, the cabin can accommodate up to six campers.
