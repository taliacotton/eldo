description: "*Collaboration with Modus Studio* \n\nThe first building in the emerging
  Art+Design District at the University of Arkansas sets a highly functional tone,
  supporting the essential needs of art faculty and students. Situated on a 3.8-acre
  satellite campus, a former light industrial area south of the main campus, the building
  is durable and flexible, but also moves beyond a strictly industrial vocabulary
  drawn from its immediate surroundings. Tall, linear light diffusion panels indicate
  the location of the primary steel building frames, provide ambient exterior lighting
  at night along an adjacent recreation trail, and are positioned in locations that
  don’t compromise valuable interior wall space.\n\nHalf the square footage is housed
  within an existing pre-engineered building frame, made efficient by introducing
  a second floor within the volume. New bays to the east and west double the building’s
  original footprint. The program houses sculpture labs, studios, woodshop, steel
  shop, mold making/wax studio, advanced technologies lab, foundry, indoor/outdoor
  work areas, storage lockers, critique space, and voluminous gallery."
