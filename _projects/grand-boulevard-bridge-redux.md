title: Grand Boulevard Bridge Redux
position: 
hero_image: ''
short-description: Grand Boulevard Bridge Redux suggests that we should slow down
  to fully experience the places that we inhabit. By tapping into the pragmatic languages
  of form and function within the site, the architect and artist composed frameworks
  that allow unexpected relationships to reveal themselves in casual encounters.
description: "In 2009, the architect worked with public and private entities to design
  and build a major artwork integrated into four bridges spanning I-670 in downtown
  Kansas City. Comprised of Main Street, Baltimore, Wyandotte and Grand Boulevard
  bridges, this became known as Pedestrian Strands. In May 2016, after structural
  cracks were discovered in the Grand Street bridge, the architect was commissioned
  to re-design this bridge. \n\nOnce again architect and artist responded to the site,
  reflecting on changes to the environment since the original commission. Increased
  traffic and activity required a deeper focus on the acoustical experience of the
  bridge. Being a Boulevard demanded a higher level of attention to lighting and finishes,
  and the project consciously set a new standard for integrated public art within
  infrastructure for Kansas City’s Parks and Boulevards system.  This project is part
  of a larger philosophy called “incremental urbanism” — an attempt to keep pace with,
  respond to, and provoke contemplation within the evolution of the urban environment.
