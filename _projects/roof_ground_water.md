short-description: Mediating technical demands of a modern theater with the excitement
  of unpredictable evolution from the outside, in.
description: "Design + Make participated in Omaha by Designâ€™s national competition
  to create an innovative urban community space in downtown Omaha. The site is adjacent
  to the future home of Boxcar 10 and the BLUEBARN theater, designed by Min | Day
  Architects. Teaming with el dorado inc and Urban Rain Design, the proposed design
  aims to visually arrest the theaters dynamic green roof through a series of faceted
  ground planes. Stormwater is strategically channeled into cisterns for irrigation
  during the dry seasons, while a service bar to the south screens the sites infrastructure.
  The urban community space provides an open air \nauditorium for the BLUEBARN theater,
  as well as a public park to the street front. We are honored to have our design
  selected from the many inspiring submissions. We look forward to working closely
  with el dorado inc, Urban Rain Design, and Min | Day to see this project into fruition."
