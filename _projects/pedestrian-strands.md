short-description: ''
description: Pedestrian Strands is the latest collaboration between el dorado inc
  and artist James Woodfill.  Sited on four highway bridges that connect the Downtown
  Loop with the Crossroads, the installation is considered a reparation of an interrupted
  pedestrian experience caused by the creation of the federal interstate in the 1960’s.
  Utilizing abstracted photographs of important, place-defining adjacent buildings
  embedded in illuminated glass panels, Pedestrian Strands embraces a strategy that
  all components of the installation comprise the artwork – the glass, the mesh guardrail
  and custom end panels with laser cut identifying street names.
