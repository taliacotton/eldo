short-description: Enhancing the functionality and use of the space indoors with a
  traditionally inspired yet modern exterior appeal.
description: "The Tylers, one of El Doradoâ€™s longest-standing clients, has recently
  brought Eldo back to conduct a three-part renovation on their historic Tudor-style
  house. As part of the reno, Eldo proposed replacing the kitchen window with a larger
  window, extending the upwards, into the master bath as a connection to the second-floor
  dormer. This then allowing for increased ventilation and natural light. A louver
  system is designed to address the overheating problem, allowing the winter sun in
  and blocking the summer sun out. \n\nWith replacing what was originally a tudor
  style window in the master bath with a much larger one, the style of the exterior
  of the house was changed dramatically. In response to this, Eldo not only adjusted
  the shape of the window to fit with the style of the house, but also made use of
  a tudor-inspired dazzle screen to protect the bathroom from excessive heat gain
  while also better compilmenting the exterior of the house. "
