short-description: Structural brackets become a focal point
description: "With El Dorado’s in-house steel fabrication capabilities (incl. structural
  steel) combined with concurrent explorations on a new manufacturing facility in
  San Francisco, heavy timber mockups were created as a structural framing approach.
  Working closely with local engineers, El Dorado explored both a ‘covered joint’
  approach and ‘exposed bracketry’ approach for the steel connector joints. Given
  the relatively intimate scale of a proposed workspace, as well as the impressive
  scale and craft of the ‘exposed bracketry’ approach it became the preferred approach.
  \n\nEl Dorado designed and prototyped two different bracket conditions, giving everyone
  involved a much more illustrative visual accounting of an important detail, which
  in turn allowed a more nuanced conversation about the pro’s and con’s of each approach."
