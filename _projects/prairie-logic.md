short-description: How a city's rooftops can become a public stage
description: |-
  Prairie Logic is a collaboration between Brooklyn-based artist Janet Zweig and El Dorado. Comprised of a full scale perforated aluminum boxcar in a 25,000 square foot sea of native prairie grass, it was commissioned by the City of Kansas City, Missouri as part of their 1% for Public Art program. The work is situated on a half-acre planted roof 4 stories above Main Street in downtown Kansas City. It is meant to be experienced at three different scales: viewed from the neighboring skyscrapers looking down; viewed in the distance from the green roof; and experienced close up as both a place of solitary contemplation and as a programmed community performance space.

  Prairie Logic is a provocative study in historical displacement and urban juxtaposition: can a historic relic of a past frontier help us re-imagine a new urban frontier amongst our cityâ€™s rooftops?
