description: David Hughes, director of the Charlotte Street Foundation, asked El Dorado
  to customize his condo in the historic Union Carbide building to accomodate his
  expansive art collection. Befitting of David’s role as a local cultural leader,
  the project grew out of creative collaboration with the arts and design community
  of Kansas City. We worked closely with John O’Brien (owner of the Dolphin gallery),
  and David himself throughout the design process. Derek Porter Studio developed ambient
  lighting strategies in response to the abundance of diffuse north sunlight in the
  condo. Anne Lindberg created a site-specific installation at the entry vestibule
  and James Woodfill designed and fabricated a pendant lighting system for the dining
  room. Finally, El Dorado designed and fabricated various custom components for the
  condo, including a steel fireplace system, a dining table and a built-in desk.
