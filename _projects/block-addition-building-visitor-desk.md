  el dorado custom fabricated a series of steel and terrazzo reception desks for the lobby of the Bloch Building at Kansas Cityâ€™s Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. The lead architect provided initial schematic designs, having el dorado complete the detailing and construction. This project posed a number of constraints that el dorado fabricators
  were able to work around including tight tolerances that required the stainless steel skin panels be custom fit in the shop prior to finishing. The simplicity
  and functionality of the final product illustrates that the distinctions made between design and construction can be blurred and illustrates what can be accomplished when an effective dialogue and collaboration between designers and makers is
  established.
