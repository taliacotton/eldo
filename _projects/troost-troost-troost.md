description: Leading up to the Troost Bridge project, EL DORADO led a University of
  Kansas Urban Design Studio to engage a 10-block stretch of Troost and the surrounding
  Troost Corridor community.  The studio proposed various projects in vacant lots
  and within abandoned buildings along the corridor as catalytic provocations. Design
  critiques were held as public forums in churches and community centers near Troost,
  and the final project, in conjunction with Kansas City Art Institute Students, was
  displayed at Paragraph Gallery in downtown Kansas City as an Art + Urban design
  exhibition.
