description: In February of 2007, the historic Waldo Theater, a once thriving cultural
  center for the Waldo neighborhood in midtown Kansas City, burnt to the ground. The
  owner of the site commissioned el dorado to design a new mixed-use center which
  could continue to accommodate small local businesses while introducing accessible
  and sustainable approaches for development at a neighborhood scale. The design for
  the new building includes complete ADA accessibility egress, natural ventilation,
  a planted roof and a commissioned art installation which doubles as a sun screening
  device for the upper level glazing system. Perhaps most importantly, the new center
  will drastically improve visibility into retail spaces from sidewalks and roadways.
