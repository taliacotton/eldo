short-description: A salvaged historic structure is reborn into the hub of a community.
description: "Volland, Kansas was founded in the late 1800s when Rock Island Railroad
  built a depot at the towns edge. On October 18, 1913 Kratzer Brothers Mercantile
  opened in Volland, built by brothers Otto and Bill. Filled with merchandise and
  serving as a post office with two telephone lines, the store quickly became a cultural
  hub for the surrounding community. \n\nAfter the store closed in 1971, the building
  sat empty for 30 years. In 2013, a couple from Kansas City purchased the building,
  deciding to turn it into an art gallery with a small living space serving as an
  artistâ€™s retreat. While the roof, second and third floors had collapsed, the masonry
  shell was left structurally intact. The design team laid out a floor plan similar
  to the original: a large, open space at the front for events and exhibitions where
  the general store was, and a second-story living space at the back, above a catering
  kitchen and restrooms."
