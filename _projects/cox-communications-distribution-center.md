short-description: A sustainable warehouse that directly expresses utility.
description: This warehouse and distribution center requested a striking visual presence
  along with cost efficiency. The project’s pre-engineered metal building system is
  specifically calibrated to the site, program, and environmental footprint. A soaring
  cantilever provides shelter for loading and unloading and protects the building’s
  metal skin from the southern sun. Low, horizontal vents along the longitudinal north
  and south facades provide high-pressure intake for a passive convective cooling
  system. Finally, a clerestory window running the length of the building allows the
  roof plane to “float” above the wall plane, generating natural interior lighting
  during the day and indirect exterior lighting at night.
