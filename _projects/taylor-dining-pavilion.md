short-description: A farm-to-table pavilion was conceived as a flat-packed system
  that was fabricated, shipped to the site and installed by El Dorado.
description: "The pavilion is situated in the midst of the client’s garden, and allows
  them the ability to experience its dynamic presence first hand. Aside from a pleasant,
  insect-free place to spend a summer evening, the pavilion was programmed to provide
  a unique functional feature. Its direct adjacency to the fruits, vegetables and
  herbs of the garden allows for meals to be developed and prepared on the spot—fine-tuned
  to that particular day’s bounty. \n\nThe project, including built-in casework and
  a custom dining table fabricated from the materials of the pavilion, was designed,
  modeled, prototyped and constructed in-house in our fabrication shop and studio.
  el dorado was both the architect and the builder of the pavilion.\n"
