short-description: One of the first prefabricated complexes, utilizing modular construction,
  in the region.
description: "Currently in the schematic design phase, Cascade Village is a large,
  mixed-use multi-family project in St. Louis within Cortex 3.0. The project is the
  first residential component of the Cortex Innovation Community, a bioscience and
  technology hub masterplanned by Ayers Saint Gross near the Barnes-Jewish Hospital
  and the Central West End neighborhood. It is part of the third phase of a large
  campus that includes a new office and hotel in a formerly industrial neighborhood.
  Cascade Village includes parking at it’s core while “wrapping” the sides and top
  of the garage with 20,000 sf of ground-floor retail and approximately 225 residential
  units. Along with a new Metrolink train stop under construction just a block away,
  the hope is that residents will leave their cars behind, walking to work in the
  Cortex district and enjoying this urban neighborhood.\n\nThe complex will utilize
  prefabricated, modular construction, one of the first in the region. This method
  not only significantly reduces the construction timeline, it also allows for more
  efficient construction off-site. The project will be characterized by roof terraces
  that overlook the Cortex Campus, providing an opportunity for residents to connect
  and interact. We hope that the gathering places will continue the innovative spirit
  of the community beyond the office.  "
