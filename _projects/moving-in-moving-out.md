short-description: Can artists elevate a self-storage facility into a community center?
description: "El Dorado has a long history of “sanctioned meddling”, collaborating
  with artists and blurring the lines between design arenas. Moving In Moving Out
  was a unique art exhibition that began with the development of the FLEX project,
  a 24,000 squarefoot, El Dorado designed self-storage facility in Topeka, Kansas.
  Elwood (the public\nart collaborative of James Woodfill and El Dorado) and Hesse
  McGraw worked closely in its creation. A collaborative, non-hierarchical structure
  was established that amplified the potential of site-specific art. Within this structure,
  the roles of artists, curators, architects and the developer were remarkably integrated.
  This allowed artists the opportunity to more fully develop specific responses to
  the site. \n\nAs part of the curatorial process, fine artist and Guggenheim Fellow
  Mike Sinclair photographed the urban context of Topeka, Kansas surrounding FLEX
  Storage Systems. He revealed his photographs one-a-day to the collaborating artists,
  and his images had profound impact on their work. Mike’s photographs, displayed
  as a simple slide show in the final exhibition."
