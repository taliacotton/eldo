title: Shelton Marshall Residence
position: 20
layout: project
short-description: An inventive use of topography to create privacy, containment and
  engagement with the surrounding landscape
description: "The Shelton Marshall Residence is built into a sloping site in Kansas
  City’s Westside neighborhood. The house’s U-shaped plan encloses terraced gardens
  and a sunken entry courtyard. The courtyard allows natural light into each wing
  of the house and provides natural ventilation to every room. On the house’s west
  facade, a covered porch hovers off of the limestone bluff twenty feet above street
  level. It overlooks the Westside tree tops and the steep incline of Madison Avenue.
  \n\nThe main entrance to the house is from the alleyway, which is roughly level
  with the rooftop. The roof boasts an even better view than the porch. It will be
  planted and enclosed by a guardrail. The house was designed for maximum energy efficiency
  with solar screening, a super-insulated building envelope, in-line water heating,
  reclaimed lumber siding, and radiant floor heating."
