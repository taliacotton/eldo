short-description: Launching midwestern intersteller aspiration through building renovation
description: "The project was an exercise in balancing accepted historical preservation
  practices while seeking to engage contemporary environmental design issues. Designed
  to be the home of a large advertising firm, the TWA Building features state of the
  art office space served by an under floor HVAC and data distribution system, energy
  efficient traction elevators and window systems, abundant natural light, improved
  vertical circulation and a recrafted “Moonliner” rocket. \n\nThe rooftop terrace
  is designed to address a range of environmental design issues. One of the largest
  planted roofs (25,000 square feet) in the region, the TWA roof features fields of
  native grasses and wildflowers as well as an outdoor deck area. These elements not
  only help to control runoff and reduce impermeable surface area, but provide a welcoming
  and natural environment for workers to enjoy. "
