short-description: Custom glulam beams elevate mundane support members to an elegantly
  artful level.
description: Located on the grounds of the Sunset Drive Office Building (SDOB) in
  Olathe, Kansas the SDOB Pavilion provides the civic agencies of Johnson County with
  an outdoor meeting space. Comprised of approximately 1,200 square feet of covered
  exterior space, the pavilion capitalizes on existing programed space including an
  adjacent wooded nature trail and botanical research garden. Incorporating eight
  glulam beams from King Louie, an iconic Johnson County building, the pavilion creates
  a connection to the history of the county while maintaining a dialog with the SDOB.
