short-description: A WWII quartermaster depot gets a new look
description: A long abandoned WWII quartermaster depot in Northeast Kansas City will
  soon home to Hardesty Renaissance Economic Development Company. As building shell
  renovations commence, we have begun to program, design, and fabricate a mobile office
  to serve daily business functions, as well as host larger community events. Working
  alongside with graduate lighting students from Parsons The New School, the design
  provides a dynamic environment for Hardesty Renaissance to kick off their new company.
  We look forward to seeing the positive change they will bring to this site and Northeast
  Kansas City.
