short-description: The adaptive re-use from light industrial to arts programming.
description: EL DORADO was hired in February 2012 as both architect and general contractor
  to develop a program and design for the new fiber department building, to be located
  in a 10,000 sq ft building on Kansas City Art Institute’s emerging north campus.
  The unique challenge of the project was the adaptive reuse of a former data storage
  warehouse into a stimulating space for art students to create and display work in
  any size, volume or media, all within a constrained budget of $100/sq ft. The project
  required provisions for a complete shell renovation, new MEP infrastructure and
  tenant finish specifically developed for the programmatic needs of one of the nation’s
  premier fiber programs. Alternative daylighting strategies in the form of Sonotube
  skylights provide natural light for studio and gallery spaces within an otherwise
  windowless building. Part of our work on this project involved fund-raising assistance
  for site improvements, including a new courtyard space between the Fiber Building
  and the H+R Block ArtSpace gallery.
