description: This project for a family of five included a complete basement renovation
  and the addition of a darkroom with a planted roof. After full demolition of the
  basement, all interior ductwork was replaced and lighting was re-designed to create
  the perception of maximum volume. The interior was organized by built-in walnut
  casework and a long wall of white bookcases visible through the basement from the
  patio. Custom cypress doors from the basement and the limestone darkroom create
  an intimate edge condition for an exterior fire pit. The plan and details were kept
  intentionally spare and simple to allow family activities (sleep-overs, reading,
  relaxing by the wood stove, etc) to become the foreground of the interior and exterior
  space.
