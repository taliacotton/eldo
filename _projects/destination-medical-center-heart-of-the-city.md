description: "Heart of the City is a bold plan to transform downtown Rochester, MN
  into a public realm of experiential zones, punctuated by community-driven activation,
  and world-class public art that sets the stage for healthy development adjacent
  to the Mayo Clinic. The Heart of the City establishes a dynamic balance between
  the contemplative and healing atmosphere that reverberates from the Clinic and a
  vibrant public space that celebrates downtown life.\n\nEl Dorado has managed the
  curatorial aspects of integrating artists and their works into the design process
  of the Heart of the City design by Coen+Partners. The artists selected and incorporated
  into the team, following a workshop in early 2019, were chosen to create works that
  emphasize the experience of being present at Peace Plaza without a focus on individual
  discrete objects. The works, to be completed in 2021, celebrate time and the pace
  of movement (Ann Hamilton, Aeon), recognize medical events and the breath of life
  (Eric Anderson, Wake Field), visualize the connections and power of our voices in
  public space (Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Voice Canopy), and considers the infinitely
  small and the infinitely large with a monument to public engagement (IÃ±igo Manglano-Ovalle,
  A Not So Private Sky). "
