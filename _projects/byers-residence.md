short-description: Influenced by the site's horizon line, the design team created
  a dynamic floor plan with natural light and expansive western views.
description: The Byers family of five had a clear vision for their new home on a stretch
  of prairie in rural Leeâ€™s Summit, Missouri. They wanted an interior layout that
  brought their family together comfortably within an abundance of natural light.
  Additionally they desired ever-present views of the expansive Midwestern landscape
  and its evening thunderstorms and dramatic prairie sunsets. The public wing of the
  house is designed to visually extend to the western horizon while a linear clerestory
  window system brings light into public and private interior rooms. A simple composition
  of exterior materials is organized by a gently sloped cantilevered roofline, rendering
  the structure low and lean in the surrounding landscape. The result is a house finely
  tuned to the subtly and drama of the earth and sky around it.
