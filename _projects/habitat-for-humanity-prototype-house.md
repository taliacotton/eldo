short-description: The Heartland Habitat prototype establishes low-tech sustainable
  design strategies through an integration of indoor and outdoor programming, resulting
  in a new model for residential infill within its surrounding contexts.
description: 'Public Architecture''s 1% for Habitat Initiative matched EL DORADO with
  Heartland Habitat for Humanity to design and build a home that surpasses the organization''s
  already strict design and sustainability standards. Our prototype features three
  bedrooms and two baths, in a flexible layout that can be modified to accommodate
  both front-loaded and rear-loaded sites. A slab-on-grade foundation allows for full
  ADA accessibility. We used simple shadi, orientation and ventilation principles
  to maximize the dwelling''s responsiveness to the environment, and we positioned
  the garage and living space to create usable outdoor space. A garden and water collection
  system ecourage families to spend more time outdoors, reducing energy consumption
  and introducing them to sustainable practices. The program aligns with Heartland
  Habitat''s mission to build simple, decent homes and communities for people in need. '
