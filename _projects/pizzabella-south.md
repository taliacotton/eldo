short-description: Warm materials seemlessly connect indoor and outdoor dining experiences
description: "At Pizzabella II (South), we took cues from the restaurant’s flagship
  location in the Crossroads while tailoring our design to the new space. \n\nThe
  bar and seating areas of have almost doubled in size. There’s a private dining room
  with two 14 person tables, one planted firmly on the ground and the other hanging
  from the ceiling. Warm Ipê screens and built-in seating stand out against two-tone
  dark gray walls, ceiling and floor. The wood fired oven (the restaurant’s key to
  the perfect chorizo and pesto pizza) remains constant.\n\nThe indoor/outdoor dining
  experience is enhanced by durable, built-in, Ipê and steel furniture, east-facing
  outdoor seating doubling as spatial edge, eleven-foot tall aluminum sliding doors
  and cleanly concealed slat-wall fluorescent lighting. "
