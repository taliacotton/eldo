short-description: '"A Monument to Rain."'
description: El Dorado was contracted to work on a multi-disciplinary team to fabricate
  a “Monument to Rain” in Seattle, Washington. The monument, located outside the new
  Georgetown Wet Weather Treatment Station, consists of a five-foot diameter, thirty-five-foot
  tall, one-and-a-half-inch thick polymer tube that is fastened to a concrete foundation
  but otherwise stands vertically unsupported, adjacent to the treatment station.
  The concept behind the monument is that when it’s raining in Seattle, it’s not raining
  inside the polymer tube; and when it’s not raining in Seattle, it will rain inside
  the tube. Each new artificial rain event within the polymer tube is programmed to
  mimic the previous natural-occuring rain event outside, both in type and intensity.
  The “Monument to Rain” will stand to celebrate the unique weather conditions of
  the Pacific Northwest and ensure that it is, indeed, always raining in Seattle.water
