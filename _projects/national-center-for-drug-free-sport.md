short-description: Environments that come alive
description: Architectural designs originate from numerous sources.  For the Drug
  Free Sport renovation project, the careful design of the mechanical system assisted
  in the unification of diverse work and meeting spaces into a cohesive whole.  In
  the system, a highly functional mechanical and electrical delivery spine was created
  to serve a variety of private and public functions.  Rather than merely hiding the
  presence of the spine, the design uses color and lighting to emphasize its importance
  as a tool to differentiate space.  As a result, common spaces benefit from an unexpected
  dynamism.  The internal functions of the project were also allowed to inform a well
  proportioned external courtyard, to be utilized by the client and the surrounding
  neighborhood.  The end result of the structural / mechanical integration is an experientially
  rich project, both spatially and visually.   In addition to an extremely vibrant
  interior color palate, El Dorado coordinated site-specific art installations by
  May Tveit (interior) and James Woodfill (exterior).
