short-description: ''
description: "Early in the design process for Market Station, Gehl developed a comprehensive
  urban design analysis for the site. Consistent with their insight, we have created
  a ground plan that promotes a network of vibrant pedestrian thoroughfares, activating
  the site’s interior with unexpected opportunities for local boutique retail environments.
  \nContinuum has lovingly named this space “The Paseo”. The Paseo supports Gehl’s
  vision for a balanced retail ecology, allowing small, local retailers to co-exist
  with large, national retailers within a single development. All this activity is
  organized around a 200-foot-long by 30-foot-tall truss standing to one side of the
  Paseo. The truss offers a generous covered area to grab a bite to eat, have a drink
  and meet up with friends."
