  The kitchen and bathroom renovation project for this Fairway couple reflects the artistic and social aspects of their personalities. Given to frequent entertainment with family and friends and the enjoyment of visual art, both projects were designed in response to the engaging openness of the houses public space. A restrained palette of durable, high quality materials was utilized to establish people and art work as the primary focus.

  When a flood control project necessitated the removal of an adjacent house and mature trees in 2011, exposing them to a busy street, Suzie Aron and Joseph Levin asked us to help them envision a new face to their home that would buffer sound. Maximizing the usefulness of an awkwardly shaped, left over parcel acquired by the client was part of the challenge as well. The program included a 15’ x 65’ lap pool with programmable LED lighting, a three season screened-in porch, a durable deck, extensive retaining walls, a custom fence (our first off-center pivot successfully implemented outdoors) and landscaping. Finally, due to the singularly uninspired nature of commercially available pool accessories, Suzie and Joe asked us to fabricate a custom stainless steel handrail and ladder for them.
