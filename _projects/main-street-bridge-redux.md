title: Main Street Bridge Redux

short-description: Embracing experimentation and collaboration at an infrastructural
  scale.
description: "The Main Street Bridge Redux was one of the first in a four-part collaboration
  between El Dorado, the City of KCMO, and artist James Woodfill. The introduction
  of a plan for a streetcar line along Main Street triggered reconsideration of the
  Main Street Bridge both topographically and pragmatically. The decision was made
  to reconstruct the new bridge due to topographical constraints of the rails. Embracing
  common DOT materials, the team was able to quickly tap into pragmatic concerns including
  acoustical improvements, life safety, ambient illumination, ease of installation,
  and overall durability. \n"
