short-description: An innovative leader in art and design education.

  Kansas City Art Institute’s 2013–2018 Strategic Plan articulates a plan to develop five, interconnected strategic goals that, when executed together, enable the Institute to attain its vision to be “an innovative leader in art and design education.”

          The Institute, convinced that there is a strong correlation between the quality of their campus facilities and enhancing learner experiences, established a strategic priority to enhance their “environment for learning and living by acquiring, renovating and maintaining space, equipment and facilities that will better respond to growth and changing needs.” It was clear to campus administrators and staff that the current state of their physical campus had impacted KCAI’s reputation, and had placed it at a competitive disadvantage in the recruitment and retention of students and faculty. To inform their physical campus and building needs for coming decades, Institute representatives and the planning and design team of Ayers Saint Gross, EL DORADO and Nelson Byrd Woltz actively consulted with the campus community to create the Campus Master Plan.

          The goals of the master plan, as articulated by leadership, were to:

          —  align the Master Plan and the Strategic Plan to facilitate the increase of full-time enrollment to 750-students;

          – return departments to the main campus;

          —  increase and improve Campus Housing;

          —  define options for the highest and best use of Institute land and facilities;

          —  improve campus circulation and connections to adjacent Institutions;

          —  minimize the Institute’s use of historic homes for campus functions;

          —  address academic and housing needs over the next 5 to 15 years;

          —  determine optimum parking demand and of the most unique and beautiful campuses in the country.
