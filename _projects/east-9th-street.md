short-description: An innovative urban planning model that, through thoughtful public
  engagement, embeds artists into the planning process of the street itself.
description: "The Lawrence Arts Center received a prestigious ArtPlace grant award
  for the infusion of art into a streetscape project along east 9th Street, from Delaware
  to Massachusetts, which will make the corridor more walkable and bicycle-friendly.
  \n\nEl Dorado was chosen to lead an urban design team for the project. Located in
  the city’s Cultural District, the seven block area is an important connection between
  historic Downtown Lawrence, the historic east Lawrence neighborhood, and the Warehouse
  Arts District. \n\nWith a high concentration of artistic, cultural, historic and
  natural amenities, the design team is focusing on celebrating these aspects of Lawrence
  and bringing them to the forefront of the community."
