short-description: An Innovative urban planning model that, through thoughtful public
  engagement, embeds artists into the planning process of the street itself.
description: "The Lawrence Arts Center received a prestigious ArtPlace grant award
  for the infusion of art into a streetscape project along east 9th Street, from Delaware
  to Massachusetts, which will make the corridor more walkable and bicycle-friendly.
  \n\nEl Dorado was chosen to lead an urban design team for the project. Located in
  the cityâ€™s Cultural District, the seven block area is an important connection between
  historic Downtown Lawrence, the historic east Lawrence neighborhood, and the Warehouse
  Arts District. \n\nWith a high concentration of artistic, cultural, historic and
  natural amenities, the design team is focusing on celebrating these aspects of Lawrence
  and bringing them to the forefront of the community."
