short-description: Park Central Apartments were part of a group of historic renovations
  that have contributed to the reinvigoration of historic, stately Armour Boulevard
  in midtown Kansas City.
description: 'Kansas City’s historic Armour Boulevard was designed by the famous landscape
  architect George Kessler around the turn of the century. The street is a product
  of the City Beautiful movement, with standard 100 foot right of way, tall deciduous
  trees, and a number of historic buildings, both single family residences and multi-story
  dwellings. Utilizing historic tax credits, El Dorado renovated the 8-story former
  Park Central Apartment Hotel at 300 East Armour Boulevard, one of several stately
  apartment buildings built in the 1920s along historic Armour Boulevard in midtown
  Kansas City. The new Park Central Apartments consist of 106 contemporary, efficient
  studio and one-bedroom apartments within a respectfully restored historic shell.
  The apartments combine splashes of cove-lit accent color with ample natural light
  set in a restrained material palette. Contemporary lighting and canopies respectfully
  contrast and highlight the restored historic shell and lobby detailing. The apartment
  color accents, subtly visible at dusk, give the façade and this block of Armour
  an enlivened street presence into the evening.
