title: Wabaunsee County Homestead
position: 25
layout: project
short-description: A respectful addition for another century of living in the Flint
  Hills.
description: |
  The Wabaunsee County Homestead sensitively modifies the primary
  structure of an 1893 homestead for contemporary use, adding a new building
  that both compliments the character of the historic structure and connects
  a new interior experience with a profound landscape. The project illustrates
  the power and continued usefulness of historic structures, extending the value
  of embodied energy already present in material and craftsmanship. New construction
  is a combination of locally harvested, repurposed and durable / low maintenance
  materials. The home is sited within the Tallgrass Prairie in eastern Kansas
  — one of the most threatened ecosystems on the planet with only 4% remaining
  — and both celebrates and responsibly engages this context.
