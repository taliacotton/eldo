short-description: A nexus for interdisciplinary engagement, outreach and research.
description: |-
  In collaboration with Ennead and BNIM architects, EL DORADO provided design leadership and planning services in the creation of a fabrication-based research laboratory that supports the pedagogy of the curriculum and provides students with a state of the art learning environment encouraging cross-disciplinary interaction and innovation.

  The design of the labs complement the studios above, by breaking down the barriers between the disciplines and vertically integrating the community of designers. At 70% of the new construction within the expansion, each of the 16 labs act as a hybrid between workshop and classroom, transforming the lab experience into a nurturing environment for learning and exploring. The new Center for Design Excellence within the fab lab offers a flexible space to allow for full-scale mock-ups and a range of uses that permit the students to showcase their work throughout the year.
