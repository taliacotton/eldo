short-description: Insisting that narrow in-fill lots are actually plenty wide for
  dignified dwellings
description: "Slender House upends the core constraint of the “too narrow to build
  on” urban infill lot. By insisting on qualities necessary for dignified dwellings
  – light, air, thermal comfort, affordability, accommodation – the project shows
  that the narrow lot is, in fact, plenty wide. \n\nBy rejecting the presumption of
  wall-to-wall infill strategies, Slender House offers a new, emblematic row house
  typology within the New York borough neighborhoods. The project proposes a three-step
  process that is replicable across many infill lot typologies. \n\nFirst, optimize
  building form within the allowable constructible volume (lot length x lot depth
  x FAR height + entitlement allowances) by first maximizing the capture of natural
  light and beneficial airflow, and second, by employing conventional construction
  methods and materials for broad application. \n\nSecond, create generous interiors
  and new models of shared/private amenities throughout the entire building and site.
  \n\nFinally, weave into the neighborhood and immediate block context."
