description: "Beginning as an envisioning exercise, for the redevelopment of the cityâ€™s
  major public space, Design+Make developed a series of master plans for the future
  of Alma City Park. A single proposal was selected from a series of designs, each
  responding to the scenic landscape of the surrounding prairie and context of Alma,
  Kansas as a whole. Phase 1 of this selected proposal focuses on creating a shade
  structure and improved entries to Alma City Pool, located within \nthe park."
