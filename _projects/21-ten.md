short-description: Restoring an iconic and historic structure while providing a new
  form of contemporary living within the downtown core.

  El Doradoâ€™s goal for this fifteen-story loft project was to develop inviting and functional living environments in a highly urban neighborhood. The result of our efforts was an extremely successful design that featured fifty-two affordable condominium units. Favorable pricing was achieved by developing a custom kit of building-specific details. The units are efficient, simple and appointed with high quality fixtures, appliances and finishes. Custom metalwork was fabricated by El Dorado in some units.

  21 Ten was part of an overall makeover for the heart of the Library District in downtown Kansas City.
