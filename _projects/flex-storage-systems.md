short-description: A self-storage facility that aims to repair blight.
description: |
  In an attempt to capitalize on the potential of a severely blighted commercial corridor in Topeka, Kansas, the owner of an inherited post-war strip center hired El Dorado to redevelop the site into a two-phase self-storage facility. A flexible building system was developed that has the unique ability to adapt to commercial or retail uses with minimal additional construction, should the economy of the region improve.

  The project is forward-thinking in its ability to adapt tried and true industry rules for successful self-storage facilities while providing a sensible redevelopment strategy for alternate future functions.

  One of the largest accomplishments of this project was the creation of “FLEX” zoning designation that allows the project to seamlessly upgrade over time from storage to commercial to retail uses as the market allows, all without the need to return to the city for rezoning.
