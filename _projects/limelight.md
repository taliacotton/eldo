short-description: A deceptively simple intervention that turns the street into community
  theater.
description: Since 2010 in fourteen cities across the world, a selection of sidewalks
  has been transformed into a impromptu stages by turning streetlights into theater
  spotlights. The result is an astonishing mix of reactions. The simple intervention
  replaces two streetlights with theater spotlights and instantly transforms the street
  into a stage and passers-by into performers, somewhere between spectacle and surveillance.
  This intentionally subtle alteration to street lighting suggests on one hand the
  latent potential of public realm as places of interaction and celebration and on
  the other hand offers an alternative approach to city’s lighting as more than securitarian.
