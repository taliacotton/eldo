short-description: A flexible model for live-work spaces
description: "El Dorado worked closely with a group of enthusiastic developers to
  develop this new mixed-use structure in the River Market district of Kansas City.
  The concrete corrugated metal and mangeras wood structure houses twelve residential
  condominium units (five of them two-story) and one retail unit facing Delaware Street.
  The design allows for copious natural lighting and ventilation within the units.
  The developers played an active role in programming the facility in response to
  input from prospective buyers. All units have very large exterior deck areas. \n\n5
  Delaware was featured in the October 2006 issue of “Dwell” magazine."
