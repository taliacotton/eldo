short-description: Urban design that is crafted.
description: |-
  In the summer of 2015, Continuum
          Partners contacted EL DORADO with a unique urban design challenge in the Lower
          Downtown District of Denver: to design an entire city block from the ground
          up. Continuum had recently completed an innovative adaptive re-use renovation
          of nearby Union Station as a major downtown mixed-use multi-modal transportation
          hub, leaving our site, the former downtown bus terminal at 16th and Market,
          open for new development. Through a rigorous massing and architectural design
          review process, EL DORADO has worked closely with Continuum’s development
          models to generate multiple site design iterations, ultimately landing on
          site strategies that deploy a high concentration of mixed-use urban density
          fronting Denver’s iconic 16th Street Mall. \n\nThrough careful attention to
          adjacent urban fabric of secondary arteries, lower density retail and residential
          has been introduced along Blake Street, Market Street and 17th Street. EL
          DORADO’s architectural strategies represent thoughtful responses to historically
          sensitive guidelines, freshly re-engaging masonry as an artisan craft through
          careful attention to fenestration and details.
