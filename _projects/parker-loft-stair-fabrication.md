short-description: Utilizing creative solutions to bring natural light into dark spaces.
description: 'In this adaptive reuse project, the owners worked with El Dorado to
  develop a finely detailed two-story loft in a raw Crossroads Arts District building.
  Translucent walls were utilized throughout the interior of the project to allow
  natural light to penetrate deeply into the space. At night, the same walls provide
  visual privacy for bathrooms and dressing while diffusing artificial light into
  a soft glow. Functional elements such as stairs, kitchen islands and clothing storage
  units separate the loft into distinct public and private zones.
