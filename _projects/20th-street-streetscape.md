short-description: An exemplar of innovative stormwater management, urban design,
  and years of work with a diverse set of stakeholders.
description: "El Dorado was selected by the City of Kansas City, Missouri to lead
  a design team responsible for planning six blocks of 20th Street, an important residential,
  commercial, and artistic corridor in the Crossroads neighborhood. We started with
  planning in 2010, developing a concept plan and then bridging documents, and later,
  construction oversight. \n\nThe design addresses multiple modes of transportation
  to create a street that is equally accessible to pedestrians, cars, cyclists, and
  buses. Public green space, street trees and plantings, and safe and efficient parking
  improve the street for residents, visitors, and businesses in the neighborhood.
  \n\nThe streetscape design focuses on the five primary goals of the Greater Downtown
  Area Plan: create a walkable downtown; double the population downtown; increase
  employment downtown; retain and promote safe, authentic neighborhoods; and promote
  sustainability. \n\nThe design team worked closely with city officials, stakeholders
  and community members over the course of planning for 20th Street. Efforts included
  urban curatorial installations such as Limelight, Saturday Night, a collaboration
  with international artist team Sans façon, and America: Now and Here with Eric Fischl.
  The team also conducted neighborhood walkabouts with KCMO Public Works as part of
  our analysis of existing street conditions. "
