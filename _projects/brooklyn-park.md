short-description: Reimagining the light industrial facility
description: Brooklyn Park shifts a common industrial typology towards a sustainable
  solution that is scalable for maximum impact. The facility replaces the common flat
  roof with a lightweight sawtooth structure, creating new opportunities for diffuse
  natural north-facing daylighting and ease of south facing PV solar panel installation.
  The sawtooth roof structure also organizes the facade in ways that are dynamic and
  unexpected. The light footprint design is ideal for clean manufacturing, introducing
  50’-0” bays for flexible programming. Brooklyn Park leverages historic industrial
  typologies to create a sustainable manufacturing facility for the 21st century.
