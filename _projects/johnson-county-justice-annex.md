short-description: A thoughtful design solution that addresses the needs of diverse
  user groups
description: 'Johnson County presented el dorado with a unique challenge: Renovate
  an old Dillons grocery store to house three different departments in the Johnson
  County Justice System – the Sheriff’s Office, Court Trustees, and Court Services.
  We set out to “Un-Dillonize the Dillons,” to turn a big box store into a stately
  civic facility. The program and the construction itself were equally demanding.
  We cut away at the facade to create a single light-filled entry for all three departments,
  shaded by a wood-clad steel trellis. We programmed 48,000 square feet of offices,
  conference rooms, and public space to meet the specific needs of each department,
  with security of the utmost importance. We added windows and rooftop monitors to
  bring natural light deep into what before was a windowless space. Existing concrete
  block was modified through the addition of extra fenestration, and by the usage
  of a two-tone color scheme. Cedar was used as a sheathing material as well as for
  the construction of shading elements.'
