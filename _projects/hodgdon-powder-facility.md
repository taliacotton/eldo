short-description: A unique workplace that makes a bold statement about brand identity
description: "The design goal for Hodgdon Powder Facility was to prove that a building
  could elevate workplace productivity in a signature structure on a “bare bones”
  industrial budget. The program, 8,000 square feet, called for a reception area,
  meeting space, offices, dining facility, and locker rooms.  el dorado chose to separate
  the uses into three buildings, orienting them around a garden of native plants and
  outdoor circulation. \n\nThe facility utilizes a Quonset hut system of construction
  that allows an extremely functional yet dynamic space for the company’s employees.
  el dorado worked closely with Steelmaster USA for the unique design, examining an
  appropriate size and span that would accommodate the needs of the client. The end
  result is a design that plays to the strengths of the pre-engineered system by focusing
  the major modifications to the end wall assemblies, allowing the dual-corrugated,
  structural panels to remain largely intact."
