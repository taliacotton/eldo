short-description: A city within a building becomes a neighborhood catalyst.
description: Located in North Omaha, Nebraska, the Highlander Accelerator answers
  an aspirational challenge to provide a community accustomed to unremarkable architecture
  with exceptional design. It is a combination of a complex, dynamic program; a topographically
  complicated site; a set of contextual issues involving social wrongs embedded in
  the history of urban planning of American cities; a client who is investing a significant
  amount of his own capital, effort, credibility and pride into the project, and;
  a wide array of stakeholders. The Highlander Accelerator is a city within a building.
  It is a home to the community with front doors on all sides, open to all and approachable
  in every respect. As part of a master planned community, the Accelerator is a neighborhood
  catalyst that provides a place for public events, entrepreneurship, urban aquaponics,
  education, community-building, business incubation and soul food.
