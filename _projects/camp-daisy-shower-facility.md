short-description: Utilitarian facilities that embrace playfulness, natural ventilation
  and efficiency.
description: "The Camp Daisy Shower Facility uses low-tech strategies to keep the
  facility cool during the hot, humid summer months.  Slatted walls allow the interior
  to breath and cross breezes to pass through the building.  Strategically placed
  ceiling fans ensure constant air movement.  The dark, painted interior has a psychological
  effect of cooling. \n\nRoughing it at camp isn’t attractive to a majority of today’s
  Girl Scouts.  The Shower Facility at Camp Daisy provides a clean, well-lit and bug-free
  place for girls to bathe while enjoying the unique experience of spending a weekend
  or week at a great place on the edge of the Flint Hills. Using annual deferred maintenance
  funds this team was able to create a unique piece of architecture and custom interior
  components to support a new splash park at Camp Daisy as well as provide shower
  and toilet facilities for the entire camp. Graduate architecture students designed
  and built large portions of the project – providing a unique learning experience
  for them and a great value for the Girl Scouts."
