The Camp Daisy Shower Facility uses low-tech strategies to keep the facility cool during the hot, humid summer months. Slatted walls allow the interior to breath and cross breezes to pass through the building. Strategically placed ceiling fans ensure constant air movement. The dark, painted interior has a psychological effect of cooling.

Roughing it at camp isn’t attractive to a majority of today’s Girl Scouts. The Shower Facility at Camp Daisy provides a clean, well-lit and bug-free place for girls to bathe while enjoying the unique experience of spending a weekend or week at a great place on the edge of the Flint Hills. Using annual deferred maintenance funds this team was able to create a unique piece of architecture and custom interior components to support a new splash park at Camp Daisy as well as provide shower and toilet facilities for the entire camp. Graduate architecture students designed and built large portions of the project – providing a unique learning experience for them and a great value for the Girl Scouts.
