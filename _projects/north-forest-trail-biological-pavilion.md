short-description: Carving light out of darkness.
description: The North Forest Trail Biological Pavilion is a highly functional addition
  to a new sculpture and architecture trail at Crystal Bridges Museum of American
  Art (CBMAA). It adds conditioned restrooms, drinking fountains, seating and maintenance
  facilities to support seasonal outdoor programming. The project was driven by the
  belief that the facility should aid the CBMAA’s aspirational mission, which seeks
  to integrate art, architecture and nature. The building upends conventional approaches
  to public hygienic facilities by staging dramatic experiences of light and seasonal
  change — its dark interior selectively allows light in, and the experience is heightened
  through a focused engagement of color, sheen and reflectivity.
