short-description: Elevate KCPT's physical environs on par with the positive impact
  it has on the Metropolitan Kansas City community.
description: "KCPT is a vessel of creative thinkers with values rooted in listening,
  understanding, and sharing. Each of the 50+ employees contribute to the company’s
  success and support the process of creating content. While their work has been at
  a consistent, award-winning level of quality over the years, their workplace environment
  has not been able to maintain that same level of quality. \n\nEl Dorado was hired
  in 2019 to conduct a programming analysis of KCPT’s creative operations and existing
  facilities.  Based on detailed discussions with the leadership and staff, a comparative
  study of the current and desired work flow, and a rigorous investigation of the
  complex conglomeration of existing structures, various scenarios were developed
  to offer a range of possible paths forward.  The scenarios vary from minimal renovations
  to selective demolition to new construction.  Each scenario was tested based on
  criteria and goals created by KCPT and El Dorado during this process.  The report
  presents a summary of the organization’s assets, constraints, and aspirations that
  informed the criteria; proposing a vision that will positively inform the upcoming
  design process to provide a workplace elevated to the quality of KCPT’s contributions
  to Kansas City. "
