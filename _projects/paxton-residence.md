short-description: Located in a neighborhood known for its long ranch style houses
  and pitched roofs, our form follows the neighborhood typology and updates it with
  a tight floor plan, careful material detailing and articulated punched openings.
description: 'The design of Heather Paxton’s home pays homage to Fairway’s predominant
  architectural style, modest ranch homes with pitched roofs. Three volumes make up
  the new house and play off the shapes and massing of the original neighborhood fabric.
  Despite recent trends that lean toward replacing small homes with new ones that
  max out envelope allowances, our design divides the program delicately throughout
  the site. The kitchen and living room center around a grand fireplace. Custom bookcases
  lead you toward the office and master bedroom. where they continue to wrap the walls.
  A guest suite on the second level peeks out of a dormer overlooking the pool This
  leave the remaining site for thoughtful landscape interventions. structures are
  visible in the distance. The materials are simple and durable: reclaimed lumber
  siding, a standing seam metal roof and a stone base.'
