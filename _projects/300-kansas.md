short-description: A 21st century light manufacturing building for the emerging economies
  of San Francisco.
description: "In San Francisco, industrial buildings have uniquely evolved as civic
  places, sites for innovation, and social condensers. This project embraces its light
  industrial lineage while celebrating the diverse energies and communities of Potrero
  Hill.\n\nEl Dorado worked during schematic design to massage the massing of the
  building to adhere to San Franciscoâ€™s strenuous zoning ordinances. The design pays
  careful attention to required setbacks, height limits and FAR restrictions without
  allowing them to dictate a generic building form.  Sawtooth forms along the east
  and west facades follow the guidelines of the City's unique bay window code, while
  offering a re-imagining of a typical industrial form.  \n\nAlong the north facade,
  exterior curtain wall systems let in generous amounts of natural light and frame
  views of the San Francisco Bay and downtown skyline.  Perforated metal panels on
  the east and west sawtooth facades manage the direct light to avoid disruptive glare
  within the industrial or R&D spades within.  A vegetated, occupied roof top provides
  stormwater management while offering an uninterrupted view of the urban fabric and
  topography for which San Francisco is famous."
