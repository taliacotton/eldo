short-description: Finn Lofts converts an early century warehouse building into a
  community of dwellings, and retail spaces that compliments the local art community
description: "The Finn Lofts is located in the heart of what has come to be known
  as the commerce street arts district in Wichita, Kansas. The project converts an
  early century warehouse building into a community of dwellings, and retail spaces
  that compliments the local art community. \n\nThe challenge was to create twenty
  seven residential units, all with natural light and ventilation. Originally used
  as a transfer point for cargo between locomotives and trucks, the existing structure
  has a large square floor plate with limited opportunities for apertures to the exterior.\n\nThe
  solution is based on the simple notion that light can be borrowed both horizontally
  and vertically. By understanding the constraints and opportunities of the site and
  existing structure, our approach focuses on four strategies: Adapting, Removing,
  Carving and Adding."
