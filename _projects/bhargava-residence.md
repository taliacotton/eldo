short-description: Panoramic views, clean design, and features let light and city
  views in, even through walls and dividers.
description: "A young medical professional wanted a design-build renovation of his
  condo,  located on the 13th floor of a prominent urban Kansas City high-rise. With
  panoramic views of downtown and glimpses of the Missouri River, the renovation centered
  around these views. We focused on a clean design with features that brought light
  and views in, through walls and dividers. \n\nThe program includes a new office,
  kitchen, and bar area. White oak paneling wraps the floor, portions of the ceiling
  and a customized walk-in closet, which serves as a signature focal point and buffer
  between the master and guest bedrooms. An avid music fan, we custom designed and
  fabricated a modular double-sided shelving unit to house the clientâ€™s elaborate
  CD collection, which also separates the main living area from the office. We also
  designed and fabricated a custom kitchen island, desk, and the master bath vanity."
