short-description: Panoramic views, clean design, and features let light and city
  views in, even through walls and dividers.
description: A young medical professional wanted a design-build renovation of his
  condo,  located on the 13th floor of a prominent urban Kansas City high-rise. With
  panoramic views of downtown and glimpses of the Missouri River, the renovation centered
  around these views. We focused on a clean design with features that brought light
  and views in, through walls and dividers. The program includes a new office, kitchen,
  and bar area. White oak paneling wraps the floor, portions of the ceiling and a
  customized walk-in closet, which serves as a signature focal point and buffer between
  the master and guest bedrooms. An avid music fan, we custom designed and fabricated
  a modular double-sided shelving unit to house the clientâ€™s elaborate CD collection,
  which also separates the main living area from the office. We also designed and
  fabricated a custom kitchen island, desk and the master bath vanity.
