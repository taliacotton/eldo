description: The Tylers challenged us to add a playroom, a bedroom and storage to
  their existing home without modifying the volume and footprint. We identified two
  locations where space could be better utilized – an unused space above the garage
  and a small, north end attic adjacent to an existing children’s bedroom. Maintaining
  the overall form and character of the existing house was required by local architectural
  review board regulations. The regulations became a useful constraint in developing
  a complimentary contemporary aesthetic of expansive glazing and subtle detailing.
