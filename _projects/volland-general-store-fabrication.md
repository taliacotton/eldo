short-description: Precisely minimal, custom steel components create a spacious community
  gathering room
description: "The design team started by taking stock of what was left of the original
  building. While the roof, second and third floors had collapsed, the masonry shell
  was left structurally intact and was in good shape. The design team laid out a floor
  plan similar to the original, with a large open space at the front for events including
  dining, dancing, and art exhibitions where the main floor of the general store used
  to be and a catering kitchen and restrooms at the back on the first floor and a
  second-story single studio apartment where storage used to be. The majority of the
  second story was not rebuilt, leaving the gallery with an open, flexible and filled
  with light, revealing two stories of windows and showing off the full height of
  the original structure. \n\nTo realize the project, our in-house steel shop designed
  and fabricated a structural steel brace with custom components to prevent deflection
  and support the exterior walls. Because the brace is a focal point within the space,
  the architect took great care in its appearance, the cornerstone of which is a highly
  precise, extremely minimal metal sleeve for the bracing cables. The sleeve hovers
  over the center of the main gathering space keeping the cables precisely separated
  at exactly the right height. This piece was designed, tested, and ultimately fabricated
  in our in-house steel shop in order to control the outcome with impeccably clean
  details."
