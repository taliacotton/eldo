short-description: An exploration in a flexible agrarian typology
description: "The first of multiple phases of design and construction at Lone Oaks
  Farm, the Hunters’ Education Center and Shooting Range brings the ethos and goals
  outlined in a previous master plan by this same design team into reality. \n\nLone
  Oaks Farm includes 1,200 acres of scenic pastures, large bodies of water, and protected
  woodlands. After a recent acquisition by the University of Tennessee, the farm was
  envisioned in the master plan as a center of hospitality, agriculture, and youth
  education for West Tennessee. As directed in the master plan, the Hunters’ Education
  Center takes cues from existing agrarian structures on the property, while adopting
  updated performance standards to provide a contemporary, durable facility. The building
  consists of approximately 6,800 square feet of meeting rooms, classroom, catering
  kitchen, and pro-shop, sited to leverage the ecology and beauty of this portion
  of the farm. The sporting games include trap, skeet, and a clays course integrated
  into the landscape. The result is a high-end experience for area youth, 4-H campers,
  amateur, and competitive shooters."
