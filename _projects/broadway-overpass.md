description: As part of the third installation of Unlooping the Loop, lighting artist
  Derek Porter proposed weaving light, color, and varying sizes of stainless steel
  mesh to create a pedestrian guardrail that, at dusk, comes to life as a lively moiré!
  This low tech graphic animation strategy creates an endless loop of patterns and
  movement, all dependent on the vantage point of the viewer. The graphic display
  unfolds slowly as a series of stills while walking, but transforms to an active
  set of shifting hatches at driving speed. From the interstate below, the moiré patterns
  take shape as an illusion at urban scale, creating a dynamic gateway to the city
  from Interstate 670.
