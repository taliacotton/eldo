short-description: A bold planning process that seeks to turn laboratories inside
  out within the public realm
description: |-
  Motley is a planning and urban design project that unleashes the creative energy from a collision between the best minds of University of Minnesotaâ€™s research labs, community organizations, world-class designers and artists at the urban nexus of two cities, the campus, and the Mississippi river.

  By connecting leading edge University of Minnesota research with global artists and world class designers, Motley will become a center for innovation and new ideas in Minnesota, and a window to the world for its diverse communities.
