  This report and proposal presents the results of
  several months of investigation into the needs,
  general operations and potential future of Kansas
  City’s public radio, KCUR 89.3.

  Based on close analysis of space and work-flow
  requirements as well as on detailed discussions with
  station leaders regarding their vision, the proposal
  suggests two alternative paths forward: One would
  include demolishing the current building and erecting
  a new one. The other involves the renovation of
  another structure, mostly likely an adjacent office
  building just to the north.

  In either scenario, the project is intended to
  strengthen the station’s ties to the community and
  allow for unprecedented levels of meaningful engagement
  with listeners, citizens and institutions.

  University officials and KCUR’s leadership team are
  confident that a well-focused campaign can raise
  $10 million to pay for a new headquarters that
  would serve the station and the community for the
  foreseeable future.
