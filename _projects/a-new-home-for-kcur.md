short-description: Inviting critical dialog with a diverse community through design
  and public programming
description: |-
  This report and proposal presents the results of several months of investigation into the needs, general operations, and potential future of Kansas City’s public radio, KCUR 89.3. The project fuses architecture, landscape architecture, and the design and programming of public space to engage an extensive (and growing) community in new and exciting ways.

  KCUR has endeavored to “open its doors” to the diverse community it serves, allowing the vibrancy of current issues and culture in the region to inform the work that it produces. It seeks to add new voices with unique perspectives to a critical conversation occurring within the community.

  Based on close analysis of space and work-flow requirements as well as on detailed discussions with station leaders regarding their vision, the proposal suggests two alternative paths forward: One would include demolishing the current building and erecting a new one. The other involves the renovation of another structure, mostly likely an adjacent office building just to the north.

  In either scenario, the project is intended to strengthen the station’s ties to the community and allow for unprecedented levels of meaningful engagement with listeners, citizens, and institutions.

  University officials and KCUR’s leadership team are confident that a well-focused campaign can raise $10 million to pay for a new headquarters that would serve the station and the community for the foreseeable future.
