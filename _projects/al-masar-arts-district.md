The Al Masar Arts District is a vibrant, 800km long linear park development that functions as an Arts Ecosystem where public art, cultural enrichment, and a growing population are nurtured simultaneously. Itâ€™s vision is to be a world-class center for the budding arts and creative scene in Riyadh and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that will represent and cultivate a new era of cultural identity for the city and its citizens. Both the program and the built form are designed to bring people of widely diverse backgrounds together in the free exchange of ideas. Through the creation of a place of discovery and the introduction of tactile experiences, the district cultivates the potential for intellectual and social exchange of artistic expression, resulting in a first-of-its-kind campus of creativity. The district offers innovative models for public-private sector partnerships to realize a cohesive, progressive vision for cultural advancement in Riyadh.
