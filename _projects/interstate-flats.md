title: Interstate Flats
short-description: A deliberate balance of restoring the old, repurposing the obsolete, and carefully introducing the new.
description: "Located along Kansas City’s historic
        Amour Boulevard, the Interstate Flats were home to the Interstate Bakeries
        Corporation Headquarters from 1952 until it’s relocation to Texas in 2009.
        In 2013 Chicago-based developer Siliman Group seized the opportunity to extend
        its community revitalization efforts and purchased the property. Unlike any
        of the other 24 restored properties dated within the 1920s along Armour Boulevard,
        this building provided a unique opportunity to retrofit a historic building
        from the modernist movement. Placed on the National Register of Historic places,
        the project utilized both State and Federal Historic Preservation tax credits.
        Through creative use of unit mixtures and occupying the lower level, the project
        exceeded pro-forma requirements and achieved 39 residential units, as well
        as a one to one parking ratio, fitness center, and a common area lounge. \n\nInnovative
        re-purposing of existing assets played a key role in the re-design—salvaging
        vintage glass partitions and doors, retaining key components of the existing
        light fixture design, restoring the solar screens, and renovating the automobile
        courtyard into the common area amenity spaces. The result is an elegant retrofit
        of a modernist structure."
