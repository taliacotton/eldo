short-description: A deliberate balance of restoring the old, repurposing the obsolete,
  and carefully introducing the new.
description: "Located along Kansas City’s historic Amour Boulevard, the Interstate
  Flats were home to the Interstate Bakeries Corporation Headquarters from 1952 until
  it’s relocation to Texas in 2009. In 2013 Chicago-based developer Siliman Group
  seized the opportunity to extend its community revitalization efforts and purchased
  the property. Unlike any of the other 24 restored properties dated within the 1920s
  along Armour Boulevard, this building provided a unique opportunity to retrofit
  a historic building from the modernist movement. Placed on the National Register
  of Historic places, the project utilized both State and Federal Historic Preservation
  tax credits. Through creative use of unit mixtures and occupying the lower level,
  the project exceeded pro-forma requirements and achieved 39 residential units, as
  well as a one to one parking ratio, fitness center, and a common area lounge. \n\nInnovative
  re-purposing of existing assets played a key role in the re-design—salvaging vintage
  glass partitions and doors, retaining key components of the existing light fixture
  design, restoring the solar screens, and renovating the automobile courtyard into
  the common area amenity spaces. The result is an elegant retrofit of a modernist
  structure."
