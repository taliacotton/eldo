short-description: Reuse, Re-Imagine & Refresh!
description: The Crossroads Hotel is a historic renovation of a former Pabst brewery
  warehouse and early 20th century political boss Tom Pendergast’s office into a 131-room
  boutique hotel. In order to allow a 100’ square storage floor plate to serve a new
  hospitality function, a new four-story atrium was carved out of the center of the
  building, revealing layers of additive architectural history while bringing soft
  northern light deep within the building. In a nod to the maker origins of the Crossroads
  Arts District, the architect designed and fabricated custom steel doors in each
  guest room and is also curating an artist engagement platform which includes an
  artist-in-residency hosted by a 2,000 square foot public gallery and studio space.
  The program draws from and will give life back to its surrounding arts district
  through exhibitions, artist commissions, performances, and unexpected artist-driven
  experiences that will enliven the hotel.
