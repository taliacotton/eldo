short-description: A re-entrification project that leverages community wealth-building
  strategies to organize an equitable planning process
description: "Historically, Albina was a thriving, affordable, and diverse neighborhood.
  Over the last 50 years, successive waves of urban renewal, interstate freeway construction,
  and a modern development framework that valued large, inwardly facing civic spaces
  displaced the people who lived there. The result is unacceptable. \n\nOn the one
  hand, Albina is home to some of Portland’s most dynamic civic and entertainment
  venues—where a diversity of people come together. On the other hand, it is about
  94 acres of central city real estate where some of our most conspicuous challenges
  converge: a lack of affordable housing and resulting homelessness; a maze of transportation
  infrastructure; the patchwork of private and public land ownership that makes pedestrian
  access to the east bank of the Willamette River impossible; and finally, the painful
  reminder of the intergenerational damage of displacement.\n\nThe Albina Vision Community
  Investment Plan, initiated by Albina Vision Trust Inc. (AVT), seeks to create a
  vision and framework for an inclusive community while healing the wounds of previous
  urban development that displaced and disempowered Portland’s Black community. A
  wide range of community partners have worked to produce a development vision that
  lays the groundwork for investment in a diverse community. The vision is anchored
  by equitable public park spaces that seamlessly connect to the river and its surrounding
  neighborhoods. It is time to take the next step and transform the vision into action,
  coordinating and integrating community values and intentions with needed public,
  private, and community investment. \n\nThe Albina Vision Community Investment Plan
  (AVCIP) aims to illustrate how a community anchored in sustained affordability,
  livability, and diversity can provide value to Lower Albina. Moreover, it will authentically
  involve the community in shaping a place that serves their needs while simultaneously
  considering financially feasible strategies for accomplishing this work over time."
