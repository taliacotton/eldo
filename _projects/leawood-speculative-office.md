short-description: Design excellence for a typology that rarely sees it
description: "A developer wanted to design a speculative office building in Johnson
  County, Kansas to attract high-tech companies. Standing in stark contrast to the
  beige, small-windowed, mansard-roofed professional buildings that are the norm in
  this part of suburban Kansas City, the 18,000 square-foot, two-story office building
  features an all glass enclosure with a carefully positioned exterior perforated
  metal scrim system that helps regulate heat gain throughout the year. \nTo the south,
  panels run parallel to the windows, removed at strategic locations (hallways, doorways)
  to open views across the entire floor. To the east and west, panels take the form
  of angled vertical louvers, their spacing varied according to shading needs of the
  rooms inside. The north is mostly open. The fa√ßade also facilitates a visual connection
  to a lush exterior landscaping package. This makes for an improved work environment
  and, as studies have shown, greater alacrity and higher productivity among office
  workers."
