Brian is an architect and urban designer whose experience is with projects of a wide range of scales. His diverse education includes Bachelors degrees in English and Art History from Williams College in Massachusetts, as well as Masters degrees in both Architecture (M.Arch) and Urban Design (M.U.D.) from Washington University in St. Louis. Upon graduating from the M.U.D. program, Brian was awarded the Master of Urban Design Book Award; the program’s highest honor in urban design. His work focuses on the interrelation of architecture and urban design, shaping the built environment through the creation of vibrant and engaging places that are both environmentally sustainable and intensely site-specific. He has completed regional master plans, large-scale watershed plans, governmental and collegiate campus plans, non-profit community center feasibility studies and multi-family housing site plans. In addition, he has designed, detailed and built projects as small as single-family row home renovations to large-scale, multi-family housing projects, with a constant eye on the intersection and interrelation of architecture and urbanism.

Brian is instrumental in advancing El Dorado’s planning and urban design studio, adeptly handling projects—urban and rural alike—in collaboration with unique project teams and stakeholders.
