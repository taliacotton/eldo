David Dowell, AIA, has more than twenty-five years of experience as a practicing architect. His portfolio of projects spans a wide range of scales, typologies, and locations, but always with a critical eye towards contemporary issues of culture, education and public well-being.

David has taught graduate level architecture studios at the Technical University in Dresden, University of Kansas, Washington University in St. Louis, and Kansas State University, where he founded the award-winning Design+Make Studio in 2011. As is true with the practice as a whole, the Design+Make Studio operates under the core premise that architects must fully engage the craft of architecture for it to have any chance at all of being meaningful.

David was recently appointed by the mayor to Kansas City’s Municipal Art Commission due to his continued civic engagement through work on projects such as Pedestrian Strands, Troost Bridge, 20th Street Streetscape and Unlooping the Loop. This appointment furthers David’s interest in the intersection of public and private development and allows him to leverage his expertise regarding the quality and impact of art and design in the public realm. Since 2011 he has been a National Peer Reviewer with the Federal Government’s GSA Design Excellence Program, an honor bestowed on an exclusive group of American architects.
