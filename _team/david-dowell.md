David Dowell is a partner at El Dorado Inc., and has practiced architecture for more than twenty-five years. He is interested in work that engages contemporary issues around culture, education and the public good. Current and recent projects include a new facility for the sculpture department at the University of Arkansas, a 1,200 acre master plan for the University of Tennessee's Lone Oaks Farm, and an adaptive reuse project for an Arts and Humanities  Residency program in Volland, KS.

In 2010 David founded the Design+Make Studio, a graduate architecture program at Kansas State University. The studio is the recipient of two ACSA Design-Build awards for their work at Camp Daisy Hindman in Dover, Kansas, and the Preston Outdoor Education Station in Elmdale, Kansas. This year's project, currently underway is a study into affordable housing. From prefabrication to micro units, to entirely new ways of thinking about co-living, the studio balanced these innovative ideas with the tempering constraints of a viable development pro-forma.
