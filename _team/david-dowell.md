David Dowell, AIA, has more than twenty-five years of experience as a practicing architect. His portfolio of projects spans a wide range of scales, typologies, and locations, but always with a critical eye towards contemporary issues of culture, education and public well-being.

David has taught graduate level architecture studios at the Technical University in Dresden, University of Kansas, Washington University in St. Louis, and Kansas State University, where he founded the award-winning Design+Make Studio in 2011. As is true with the practice as a whole, the Design+Make Studio operates under the core premise that architects must fully engage the craft of architecture for it to have any chance at all of being meaningful.
