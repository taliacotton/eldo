In his first eight years with ELDO, he worked on the Willoughby Design Barn, TWA Building, Taylor Dining Pavilion, National Center for Drug Free Sport, FLEX Storage, and 5 Delaware among others. While elsewhere, Doug earned a reputation as a strong project manager working on the Cerner Innovations Campus and Garmin Phase 3 in Kansas City, the Tse Ping & Cheng Cheung Sports Center at UPenn, and the Pegula Arena at Penn State.  
  
Doug is excited to rejoin us in Kansas City and take in the office culture, design rigor, and the overlap of fabrication and design.
