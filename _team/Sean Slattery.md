Sean is an associate principal and project manager at El Dorado and has been with the studio since 2003. When developing designs, Sean envisions the project from the end-userâ€™s perspective to create solutions that have real-world applications. While part of the el dorado design studio, Sean has managed and worked on more than a dozen multifamily residential projects, including acting as project manager for Cortex 3.0, a new 200,000 sq ft pre-fabricated modular commercial multifamily development in midtown St Louis. Many of these projects have brought together a unique set of stakeholders including community members, civic entities and private developers. Throughout the design and construction process, Sean takes great care to communicate consistently with all involved parties; he creates a natural raport interacting with project teams and clients. He brings an elevated level of detailing to his daily work and drawings. This approach produces feasible, clean construction documents that result in minimal questions and tight bids.

Sean is active in his community, volunteering with the KC Irish Center, the Olathe School District Design Academy and Brookside Soccer Club. He has served on the AIA Kansas City Board of Directors; Calvary Lutheran Church Board of Elders; Calvary Lutheran Church Building Committee; and volunteered with Project Lead the Way.
