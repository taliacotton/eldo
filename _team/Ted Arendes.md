Ted is a versatile project manager at El Dorado with extensive experience in both design and construction. He uses technical expertise based on a strong design-build background to provide unique project solutions. While a student at the University of Kansas, he earned “boots on the ground” experience designing and building a modular home with Studio 804. After graduation, he worked for five years in North Carolina amassing knowledge, experience, and awards while designing and building custom homes and commercial projects. Ted joined El Dorado in 2012 and has been critical to the utilization of our fabrication shop, including the design, fabrication and installation of details and elements for our mixed-use and residential projects. Ted’s knowledge of the construction industry and methodologies has proved invaluable in creating tight and comprehensive construction drawing sets.
