Tamra is a staff architect at El Dorado, and it was in her last year at Kansas State University that she first became involved with El Dorado while participating in the collaborative Design+Make studio. Since then she has worked on a variety of projects, both architectural and curatorial, and has learned the power of collaboration and communication. Interests in environmental stewardship, integrated art and social awareness complement Tamraâ€™s effort in architecture, graphics, and curation to provide a foundational moral design compass.

Her past engagements include being an Intern Coordinator and Art Program Director at a previous firm where she was also involved in the AIA Committee on the Environment. Tamra has completed the AIA San Antonio Professional Practice and Leadership Program and continues to further her personal knowledge through Accreditation education. At El Dorado, she helps advance sustainability discussions within the practice and process of design.

Her project experience varies from small-scale design/build installations to large-scale building designs and includes involvement in the early programming and space-planning phase.
