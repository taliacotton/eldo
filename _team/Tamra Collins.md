Tamra is a project designer at El Dorado, and it was in her last year at Kansas State University that she first became involved with el dorado while participating in the collaborative Design + Make studio. Since then she has worked on a variety of projects, both architectural and curatorial, and has learned the power of collaboration and communication. Interests in environmental stewardship, integrated art and social awareness complement Tamraâ€™s effort in architecture, graphics, and curating to provide a foundational moral design compass.

Her project experience varies from small-scale design/build installations to large-scale building designs and includes involvement in the early programming and space-planning phase.
