Shaped by her extensive architectural background, Sophie serves as a project architect with experience spreading through multifamily, high-end residential, higher education, civic and now social justice work, her passion. With a keen design eye, she can manage complex projects with ease and efficiency. Her strong communication skills make her a well-rounded, collaborative team leader. She is organized, dedicated and thoughtful not only toward colleagues but to the ultimate success of the project. Listening intently, she aims to unravel the projectâ€™s purpose and seeks the most efficient ways to coalesce aspects of space making with building function and structure. 

As project Director for Parrott Creek, Sophie helps to steer the success by staying on task and responding to the teams needs. Balancing client presentations, user engagements, coordinating with consultants, she applies what has been discussed into documentation. 

Other recent project roles include Project Architect on the Red Sands Conservation Park, a desert dunes restoration project that invites public engagement through cycling, equestrian and educational opportunities. And at her previous firm, Project Architect for Deplaning at the Portland Airport, another complex project including multiple engineers to coordinate between new and existing building.
