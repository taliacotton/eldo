Chris Burk is a principal with El Dorado and functions as manager of our in-house fabrication and prototype shop as well as an architectural project manager. He leads the majority of the studio's research and development, with extensive experience in our most technically complex projects. Chris applies his knowledge gained through the production and installation process to architectural design, resulting in projects that benefit from a history of practical application. Because of his understanding of the close relationship between design and making, he is able to develop pragmatic yet innovative solutions for projects of all types, from large scale installations to complex new construction and renovation projects. In addition to his deep understanding of materials and construction, Chris is particularly skilled in designing to support operational processes at institutional and industrial facilities.
