Trey joined El Dorado in November 2020 as a designer for the Portland Office. Prior to joining El Dorado, Trey worked as an architectural designer with Perkins Eastman on the construction of the New Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto. While in graduate school, Trey gained experience interning with SOM on the Long Beach Civic Center and had the opportunity to travel abroad to India for studio research into Smart Cities initiatives in Bangalore.

Hailing from California–though with East Coast roots– Trey believes architecture is rooted in our experience of a place. Through his work with El Dorado, Trey has gained invaluable experience in designing new typologies of space where the emotional sphere of art and design may be celebrated publicly.
