Nancy is a principal and El Doradoâ€™s controller and chief financial manager. Nancy joined El Dorado in 2000 and, with her exceptional attention to detail, she manages tight administrative, accounting, and HR departments. In her 20 years with the firm, she has developed, and continually reviews and improves, the internal administrative and accounting processes/procedures firm-wide. She has created customized reporting methods to evaluate past performance as well as innovative tools to monitor sales projections, staffing, and overhead budgets. In her capacity as the point person for big-picture fiscal operations, Nancy keeps owners up to date and well informed of all financial matters.

Nancy works very closely with insurance agents to keep El Dorado policies current and the office covered on all fronts. But perhaps most importantly, Nancy has become a specialist in risk management through her extensive experience and thorough contract administration.
