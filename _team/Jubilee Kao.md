In the final year earning her Master of Architecture at Kansas State University, Jubilee has had the opportunity to work with David Dowell and Larry Scarpa in the KSU Design+Make studio. Through this, she was able to focus on the topic of well-designed, implementable affordable housing in the Crossroads area of Kansas City. This project allowed her to dive into the history of housing, climate/culture, client proforma, and consciously study different design approaches to increase access to affordable housing.

Jubilee is passionate about the poetic process of storytelling and the language that architects use. From graphic design, sketches, and content creation, Jubilee finds enjoyment in the way that architects can communicate design through a multifaceted approach.
