Derik is a project architect at El Dorado. Originally from Nebraska, Derik is returning to the mid-west after spending the last 7 years in Seattle, WA. The breadth of his work has developed into an intentionally diverse portfolio across scales and typologies. Most recently he has been working on mixed-use commercial developments, multi-family housing projects, and urban planning initiatives.

Derik was the 2016 recipient of AIA Seattleâ€™s Emerging Professionals Travel Scholarship, which allowed him to travel extensively, exploring the role of emerging technologies within the practice of architecture. In 2017, he curated the exhibition Smarter Buildings, chaired Future-Ready Building: Disruptive Technology & Data-Driven Design, and presented reseach in both Chicago and Dallas.
