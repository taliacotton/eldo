Orignally from Zhengzhou, China, Spike joined El Dorado's Portland Office as a Project Designer. Spike received his undergraduate degree from Tongji University in Shanghai and went to both Washington University in St. Louis and SCI-Arch LA for his graduate study, graduating with distinction from SCI-Arc with a Master of Architecture.

In a professional capacity, Spike has worked on a diverse set of projects ranging from hospitality and performance arts spaces to office, educational campuses, regional planning and landscape. This diverse experience across different scales and typologies give him the ability to quickly dive into completely new and complex situations and work through every detail with creative solutions. He believes every project and client is unique, and the challenge of all architects is to deliver the best design through research, testing and quality control in each unique context. This challenge has also become his passion in this profession.
