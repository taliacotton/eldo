David's career in architecture began in 1990 with the design of site-specific Passive Solar homes in the Texas hill country around Austin. Since that time he has worked on a variety of building types in locations ranging from New England to Beverly Hills to British Columbia. Since 2003 he has been based in Portland, Oregon.

David's early life experiences working on archaeological excavations in the Ancient Roman Forum and in Castellammare di Stabia near Pompeii instilled in him a deep appreciation for timeless design and enduring construction techniques. His respect for the client's budget and aspirations for the project, his fastidious attention to detail, and his appreciation for the collaborative nature of architecture make David a committed partner to his clients, contractors, consultants and coworkers.

Some of the more notable projects in David's portfolio include the Booker T. Washington Arts Magnet high school in Dallas, Texas; the Patricia Reser Center for the Arts in Beaverton, Oregon; a mixed-use brewery, restaurant and office building in Hood River, Oregon; a stainless steel pavilion at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, MA; a waterfront Fire & Rescue station in Portland, Oregon; and the Pink Martini Headquarters. David is currently serving as managing principal on Parrott Creek, a residential counseling and recovery center for traumatized youth in Clackamas County, Oregon.
