Monica joined El Dorado in March of 2016 and the firm hasn't been the same since! She is the first face of the firm--the friendly voice that will likely answer your call--welcoming every client, visitor, and employee with a seemingly endless enthusiasm that lifts the spirits. Monica's roles in the office are boundless; however, as El Dorado's Administrative Assistant, she oversees all administrative functions assisting with accounting, finances, delivery and receiving, payroll, human resources, and much, much, more. Monica keeps the office running smoothly and efficiently!
