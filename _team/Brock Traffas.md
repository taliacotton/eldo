Brock is a designer at El Dorado. His involvement with El Dorado began as a student at Kansas State University’s Design+Make Studio. There he was project manager and lead designer on the Waldo Duplex where he bridged academic concepts with logistical expertise. This project has gone on to win many prestigious awards including an Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA) Design Build Award and an AIA Honor Award for both Kansas City and the Central States region, as well as being featured in ARCHITECT Magazine, The Architect’s Newspaper, and Dezeen.com. With each project, he offers a unique fusion of construction expertise and a high standard for producing graphics and renderings.

Currently, Brock is working on _The Rainbow_ at New Holland Island in St. Petersburg, Russia and at the San Francisco Art Institute, as well as the Volland Foundation Arts + Humanities Residency Program building.
