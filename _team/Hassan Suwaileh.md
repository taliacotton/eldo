Hassan joined El Dorado as a Designer. Originally from Qatif, Saudi Arabia, Hassan came to Eldo by way of Fay Jones School of Architecture at the University of Arkansas.  
  
Through two design-build studios in college, Hassan gained an appreciation for experimentation and fabrication in architecture. He enjoys studying both the strengths and limitations of materials and prototypes through a hands-on design approach. In college, he also became fascinated with how architecture and design can be used to address social problems at multiple scales. Hassan believes that good design should and can be for everyone. These strengths and interests align very well with the work that El Dorado currently has on the boards and will be involved in long into the future.
