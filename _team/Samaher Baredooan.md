Sam has joined El Dorado as a designer for the Portland Office. Originally from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Sam completed her undergraduate study at Wentworth Institute of Technology School of Architecture in Boston and received her master's degree from Syracuse University School of Architecture. Along with all these places, Sam also had the opportunity to call New York City and Girona, Spain home at one point.  
  
Sam is deeply interested in how urbanism, architecture, media and culture intertwine to create the world we live in. Her work experience with urban-scale developments in both Boston and New York City paired with a unique atonement to world culture has already proven invaluable.
