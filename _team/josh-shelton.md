Josh Shelton is a partner at el dorado inc. el dorado’s unusually diverse portfolio contains work in academia, public art, urban design and infrastructure, and master planning. Current proj-ects are underway in the Kansas Flint Hills, Northwest Arkansas, Denver, Wichita, Seattle, Cal-gary, St. Louis, Portland, Omaha, and of course, Kansas City. David is interested in exactly four things: the usefulness of higher education, new ways of problem solving through artist collabora-tions, the regenerative value of adaptive re-use and a revitalized public realm.

For el dorado Principal Josh Shelton, facade design and fabrication are simultaneous, rather than sequential, practices. “el dorado was founded on the premise that design and fabrication were a unified act,” he explained. The firm often prototypes or constructs physical components of its project in its in-house fabrication shop. “Our approach to facade design evolves from that hands-on rigor and sense of craft that we’ve developed over the last 20 years of being a practice,” said Shelton. Shelton will participate in the “Materials + Surfaces” presentation block at the upcoming Facades+AM Kansas City symposium with A. Zahner Company‘s L. William Zahner and Paul Neidlein, of JE Dunn Construction.
