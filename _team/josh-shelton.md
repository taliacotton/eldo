Josh is a partner at El Dorado Inc., primarily focused on design excellence within our shared urban environment. He has a particular interest in mission-driven urban design projects that maximize social impact within a diverse set of communities and stakeholders. He has a depth of experience with urban design mixed-use projects that leverage complex funding sources, ranging from HUD funding and tax credit financing to EPA grants and private sector philanthropy. His current projects include an industrial and residential mixed-use development in Minneapolis and the construction of a new city block in the lower downtown district of Denver.
