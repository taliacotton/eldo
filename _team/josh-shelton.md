Josh Shelton, AIA, is a partner of El Dorado, and leads the firm's Portland office. His primary focus is on design excellence within our shared urban environment. He has a particular interest in mission-driven urban design projects that maximize social impact within a diverse set of contexts, typologies and communities. He has a depth of experience with catalytic projects that leverage complex funding sources that include innovative public-private partnerships, HUD funding, tax credit financing, EPA grants and private sector philanthropy. Josh believes that design excellence should be available to anyone, anywhere.

Josh has taught Urban Design at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas; Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri; and Lawrence Technological University in Detroit, Michigan. He currently sits on the Deanâ€™s Advisory Board for the University of Tennessee College of Architecture and Design and serves regularly as guest critic for the University of Oregon, Portland State University and the University of Idaho.
