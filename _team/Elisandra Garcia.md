Elisandra Garcia is a Visiting Professor of Architecture at the Portland Architecture Program, for the University of Oregon. As the Design for Spatial Justice Fellow, Garcia has created the Urban Violence Laboratory PDX, where graduate students craft an architectural thesis proposal driven by social and environmental justice prompts, collectively and individually responding to an Urban Violence issue in Portland. Garcia was born and raised in the border town of Ciudad Juárez, México. Her background amplified her curiosity and drive to understand urban violence, its consequences, and possible solutions. Eli Studio focuses on architecture, research, art, and activism and at all scales, and on both sides of the border. To make this possible, Eli Studio curates and directs; art, fashion, music, and dance shows in benefit of local groups and non-profit organizations who are courageously working to stabilize cities and communities under severe violent environments. Garcia believes in the power of personal narrative, academia, and action in the search for equity and peace.
